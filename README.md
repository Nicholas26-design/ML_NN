Overall, the goal of this program is to do the following:

1. Recommend topic areas for blog posts using a data driven approach.
2. Get insights into user interactions with our blog posts and other content posted on platforms like LinkedIn. How they are interacting.
3. What's pulling users in? What to read and write next?
4. Develop into a model that will do well on different types of unseen data.

Stretch goal: Getting and analyzing data on users interacting with our content. For example: what sectors are users employed in, which could be valuable in targeting ads.


To that end: I'm going to download 2 sample datasets. 

One is a dataset containing information about randomly chosen Medium articles published in 2019. This is to emulate the blog format.

The other is an Ad Click Prediction Dataset. This will address click-through on our ads/articles.

All data is freely available on Kaggle.
