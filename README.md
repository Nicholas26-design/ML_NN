# Project Overview

The goal of this program is to:

1. Recommend topic areas for blog posts using a data-driven approach.
2. Gain insights into user interactions with our blog posts and other content posted on platforms like LinkedIn.
   - Understand how users are interacting with the content.
   - Identify what is pulling users in and what topics to focus on next.
3. Develop a model that performs well on different types of unseen data.

### Stretch Goal:
Analyze data on users interacting with our content. For example:
- Identify the sectors users are employed in, which could be valuable for targeting ads.

## Datasets

To achieve these goals, I will use two sample datasets:

1. **Medium Articles Dataset (2019)**  
   - Contains information about randomly chosen Medium articles published in 2019.  
   - This dataset emulates the blog format.

2. **Ad Click Prediction Dataset**  
   - Provides insights into click-through rates for ads/articles.  
   - Useful for understanding user engagement with content.

All datasets are freely available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).
